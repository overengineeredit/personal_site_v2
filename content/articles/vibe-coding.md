summary: "Over the last few weeks, I’ve needed to build a new personal website. Although I’ve been skeptical about “vibe coding,” I decided to give it a try. \n\n My conclusion from the exercise is that it works, sort of. I used Cursor, as it is the current market leader (and the closest to my current setup, though any tool will do)."
