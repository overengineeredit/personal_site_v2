## Background

I'm Peenak Inamdar, an engineering leader passionate about building and scaling high-performing teams and platforms. Currently, I focus on transforming complex technical challenges into simple, scalable solutions that empower users and drive business growth. Throughout my 20+ year career, I've led engineering organizations through rapid change, modernizing legacy systems, migrating data and content, and architected cloud-native platforms for companies such as Renaissance Learning, The Muse, Google, Walmart, and Royal Caribbean. My expertise lies in fostering resilient teams, mentoring future leaders, and championing agile, user-centric development practices.

## Interests

Professionally, I'm interested in building impactful engineering cultures and advancing developer experience. Outside of work, I enjoy mentoring, volunteering, and exploring new technologies. I'm always learningâ€”whether through collaboration, training, or hands-on experimentation.
